My portfolio website is bright and creative with a minimalist feel to it so that it gets straight to the point for the user. It's purpose is to tell the user who I am and what I do and allow them to contact me with minimal effort.

My target audience is software companies and their HR departments or companies looking for a web developer with a creative flare. The user can see I have potential with my creative nature and am able to use HTML and CSS.

I researched and found many different styles of web development portfolios online and was drawn to the more simplistic, clean, bright, creative portfolios. Images or photos of people on the home page introducing themselves seemed the most logic way to go about it for me.

_Colour Palette:_

I originally wanted to go with really safe neutral colours like white, tan, beige. But once I started to style with these colours I didn't feel inspired by them. So I did some research and found a colour palette that made me feel creative and captivated me and I decided I would work with something similar to that (inspiration image below)

_Representing my artist talents:_

I wanted to add an element to my portfolio to represent my creative talents. I decided to draw some original sketches in paint that I would use on my pages that were relevant to the content. I found this to be really enjoyable and a good way to express my creativity to the user.

**Sketches created and used in my portfolio:**

_Extra features to also target dyslexic users:_

As a dyslexic person, I wanted to use that to my advantage when it came to the visual side of my portfolio, including the layout and overall execution of my website. I wanted a font that was easy to read so I chose Open Sans. I wanted there to be minimal text used on my pages so that the user could see what message I was trying to portray without having to search for it. I wanted everything centered where possible and the menu bar to be clear and easy to read and access.

**Sitemap**

I decided to have my portfolio layout across all device sizes the same so that it is easily recognises by the users. This is something I find a little distracting and sometimes confusing myself when I go from an IPhone to a desktop screen.

**Wireframes created in Figma**

**Styling in CSS vs SASS**

I changed from CSS to SASS before deciding to do some more research into it and found I could use variables to achieve what I wanted in CSS styling in regards to repeat colours and font-sizes. This way I could focus on developing my skills even further in CSS styling.

_Devtools_ was extremely helpful when it came to altering my styling in CSS. Designing and completing the IPhone screen size first was a great help. All I then needed to do was to add media break points for the IPad and desktop screen sizes.

**Overall design and layout of portfolio**

_Home Page_

![image](./docs/home-page.png)

Clean and simplistic design with my name, job title and a unique original sketch that captures the users eye.

_About Me Page_

![image](./docs/about-me-page.png)

I have included a photo of myself so that the user recognises who I am as it is the same photo I have used in my linkedin profile. I have given a brief paragraph on my experience. I have a resume button in lavender encouraging the user to click on it which will then open a PDF of a mock resume for them to access and read. Under that I have listed my tertiary qualifications and an original sketch at the bottom of the page.

_Contact Page_

_Amended Contact Form to Center it in the Page_

![image](./docs/amended-form.png)

I have created a contact form so that there is minimal effort on the users behalf to have to engage and contact me. I have used lavender for the submit button so it is clearly visible to the user. At the bottom of the page I have inserted another original sketch of my location.

_Top of the Blog Page_
